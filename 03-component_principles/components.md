# Components

Components are the smallest parts of a system that can be deployed independently.

## Deployment Methods

Components can be deployed in two ways:
- Separately (like plugins)
- Grouped together into an archive

## Characteristics of Well-Designed Components

Well-designed components have the following characteristics:
- They can be deployed independently.
- They can be developed independently.

## History of Component Architecture

In the 1970s, linking loaders divided applications into components, but this method was too slow for large projects. Advances in RAM and processors during the 1990s made component architecture feasible. Today, component architecture is a common practice.
