# The Two Values of a System

- Behavior: The functional features of the system.
- Architecture: How the behavior operates and the flexibility to handle changes in behavior.

## Weighing Architecture Over Behavior

Architecture is more valuable than behavior. Architecture offers flexibility. Behavior without architecture is costly, and therefore less of a priority.

## Conclusion

Applications can be broken down into either behavior or architecture. Not investing in architecture is costly because behavior that is hard to maintain increases labor costs.
