# What Is Architecture

Architecture is the foundational principles that guide decisions while creating an application.

## The Goal of Architecture

The primary aim of architecture is to start or modify a system till it is easiest to build and maintain.

## The Chapter's Primary Argument

Businesses tend to opt towards fast and messy design when building new software. Companies claim, rushed and sloppy architecture is more productive before getting to market.

The author argues that the nature of the market will always drive software to add features before cleaning up messy code. In other words, difficult-to-maintain software remains difficult.

The book's remedy is to start with clean design. This will reduce the cost of maintenance fees, which will save the company money in software expenses in the long term.

## Conclusion

Clean development is always fast and productive on all time scales. Fast and messy design only gives the illusion of productivity in the short-term. Clean development is the most practical strategy when designing and maintaining a system.
