# Programming Paradigms

Programming paradigms are different approaches you can use to write code. They are like different tools. Each tool can solve their own unique problems. All attempt to improve maintenance, debugging, and readability.

## Structured Programming

Structured programming emphasizes clear and modular code. It is organized into logically structured blocks, in the form of, loops, conditionals, and functions.

## Object-Oriented Programming

Object-oriented programming allows for the creation of independent modules. These module objects can prevent important parts of the system from becoming dependent on volitile parts.
